Specification for stdlib and mlogx(mindustry logic extended)

This project is a work in progress! These instructions are not complete!

## Guide to making programs
This guide assumes you already know how to make mlog programs, but are frustrated when you try to make larger projects.

Need help? I'm BalaM314#4781, you can ping me in the #logic channel of the official Mindustry discord.

### For larger projects
Place your .mlog or .mlogx(supports the extended instruction set in this document) files in /src.
Running the compiler with `node compiler/compile.js` transpiles .mlogx files into .mlog files, and then combines all your separate files into one(out.mlog), which you paste into a processor in-game.

Note that you don't *need* to use mlogx, you can call functions and bundle your files with vanilla MLOG(it'll just be annoying to write function calls without `call`).

Note: Without jump or call statements, the only file executed is main.mlog(x). Your other files should contain functions or subroutines that you can call. As this project is a WIP, currently all functions from the stdlib are included in your output file, however, they don't make your program any slower unless they are executed. This is temporary, but I need to make a linker first, which is... non-trivial.

### For standalone files
Create a folder and place one or more .mlogx files inside. They will be compiled into .mlog files and placed in the same directory.

## Functions
yeah we have functions! See count_block_type.mlogx for an example.

Builtin function names start with an underscore so they don't interfere with your labels and/or your own functions.

Example of format used in this doc:

_function_name(_argument_name) -> _output_variable_name

Description of what the function does.

Before calling a function with `call`, make sure to set its input variable.
Functions do not check if the input is set, for speed.

"Under the hood", functions are simply a jump label that expects a variable to be set, can write to a variable, and use @counter and <stack1> to jump back to where you called them.

## List of custom instructions

mlogx has extra instructions to make writing code easier.

### call

`call [function_name]`

Calls a function. Equivalent instructions:

`set _stack1 @counter`

`op add _stack1 _stack1 3`

`jump [function_name] always`

### increment

`increment [variable_name] [amount(5)]`

Increments a variable by a number. Equivalent instructions:

`op add [variable_name] [variable_name] [amount]`

### return

`return`

Returns from a function. Equivalent instructions:

`set @counter _stack1`

### throw

`throw [error_message]`

Throws an error. Equivalent instructions:

`set _err [error_message]`

`call _err`

## List of variables
_stdout: default [Message] to output messages. Standard output.

_stderr: default [Message] to output errors. Can be the same as _stdout.

_stack1: Contains an address that should be jumped back to once a function call is complete. You should never need to set this, the `call` instruction does it for you.

## List of functions

_count_building_type(_building_type) -> _num_buildings

Returns the amount of linked buildings of a particular type.

Instruction count: 4+6*@links



_err(_err)

Outputs a message in red to _stderr and terminates.

Yes I know it's confusing that the function and parameter have the same name. :cringe:



_count_unit(_unit_type) -> _num_units

Returns the amount of (alive) units of a particular type.



_flag_unit(_unit_type) -> @unit

Binds and flags an unused unit.

WARNING: will block if no units are available.

More coming Soonâ„¢.

## Preprocessor directives

They're cool so I added them.

`#program_type [append, main, never]`

never: Causes a file to never be included in the compiled program. Must be on the very first line. Useful for files like all_commands.mlogx.

main: Specifies that a file is a main program, and functions should be appended to it.

append: Specifies that a file should be appended to the main program in a project.

`#require [var1, var2...]`

A list of variables you want to include.

`#function functionName(arg1, arg2) -> outputVar`

Specifies that a program is a function. Eventually will be used for intelligence.
## Requireable vars
Not prefixed with an underscore, so take note if you're using them!

`cookie`

Generates a random cookie based on the processor's x and y coordinates. Useful for flagging units.

`core`

[NYI] Uses a unit to ulocate the nearest core. Errors if no units are available.
